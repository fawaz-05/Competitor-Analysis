It has good build quality, impressive battery life, and balanced music performance. Every instrument and vocal is clearly audible, and the music is well-balanced.

You get all details of the laptop in hp website from the serial number given in the invoice warranty slip. I have ordered this laptop 3 times but all laptops warranty started before receiving the laptop. Then I have contacted hp support and they have told me that the laptop is commercial not consumer laptop, so warranty cannot be changed. So 2 laptops rejected but one laptop received. After checking, it's warranty already activated in Aug 24, before 3 months. So returned the product but refund policy very pathetic. Amazon taking 13 days to give the refund. Amazon has not mentioned it in return policy. They are also not giving replacement but you can see 7 days replacement in buying page.

2025-01-28 13:38:07,"Samsung Galaxy M05 (Mint Green, 4GB RAM, 64 GB Storage) | 50MP Dual Camera | Bigger 6.7"" HD+ Display | 5000mAh Battery | 25W Fast Charging | 2 Gen OS Upgrade & 4 Year Security Update | Without Charger","I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M05 for just under INR 6500, and I must say, I am very impressed! For the price, this phone is an absolute steal and offers incredible value for money.The large display is a real highlight, providing a great viewing experience for day-to-day tasks. Despite being a budget phone, it has a premium feel in hand, which is a pleasant surprise. The build quality is solid, and it doesnâ€™t feel cheap.Battery life is outstanding! It lasts all day with moderate use, and I donâ€™t have to worry about charging frequently. Whether you're browsing the web, checking social media, or streaming videos, it gets the job done efficiently.While it's not a phone meant for heavy tasks like gaming or intensive apps, it excels at handling basic jobs like calling, texting, browsing, and light media consumption. It's perfect if you're looking for a reliable phone for everyday use without breaking the bank.Overall, Iâ€™m really happy with my purchase. If you're looking for a budget phone that does the essentials really well, the Samsung Galaxy M05 is an excellent choice!Read more | All I can say it's worth it considering that PriceYou can't expect High range Performance in 7k Budget mobilesLet's talk About Mobile- Big Screen Looks good- Build-in Quality is Good- Battery is Good- Camera Quality Below Avg they said 50mp expected more but it's below avg- Processing is Above AvgIt's good for Normal Use not for heavy useRead more | Build quality is good, looks premium; Weight is well balanced, feels lighter in hand; Decent camera; so far performance is good. Suitable for Casual users.Read more | Processor- Slow processor but i guess you cant ask for much in this price bracket, the UI is smooth most of the time and its good enough to use social media apps and to watch videos and allCamera- Not very good but well we cant ask for much in this price range.Screen- Its actually really good for normal day to day usage, the colours and the sharpness is very decent,  i dont like the inclusion of thick bezels but i guess again its the price segment so cant ask for much, viewing angles are kinda badBattery- will last you a whole day if you try, it couldve been better thoBuild- Its solid, yes it makes the phone heavy and bulky but yeah its solid and has a good in hand feelingRead more | I've been using this Samsung phone for a bit, and here's the lowdown. Considering it costs around â‚¹6,500-â‚¹7,000, I think it's a pretty great deal.Sure, there are some compromises. No fingerprint sensor (the face unlock compensates some what for that), and yeah, not having a charger in the box is a bit of a hassle if you don't already have one. The speakers could be better, and a Full HD display would've been nice.But let's be real, at this price point, you can't expect perfection. If you're like me and just need a reliable phone for everyday stuff â€“ calls, texts, social media, and some streaming â€“ this phone gets the job done.Gaming enthusiasts might want to look elsewhere, but for casual users, I think this Samsung device is a solid choice.Would I recommend? Absolutely, for basic usage.Read more"
2025-01-28 13:38:09,"iQOO Z9x 5G (Tornado Green, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) | Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 with 560k+ AnTuTu Score | 6000mAh Battery with 7.99mm Slim Design | 44W FlashCharge","Bought this for office sim as a secondary mobile with op12 as primary.I generally use this mobile for office calls and little youtube and browsing here and there. With moderate usage it lasts two days easily.Forgot that this phone has a camera and if your priority is a secondary phone which lasts longer with decent processor, go ahead and purchase.No hanging, no heating, not heavy and super fast finger print reader. Display quality is okishRead more | First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more | Best purchase I had ever , bought 4/128 at just 10499 and the refinement and smoothness of the phone is top notch , battery is top notch as aspected which is Showing in reviews camera performance of processor everything is good except: delivery of Amazon I purchased it 3 times then I got it 2 times it goes cancelled or undelivered without out for delivery that is totally not expected from e commerce like Amazon but after getting phone everything got forgotten........afterall terrafic purchase go for it without any hesitationRead more | wORKING GOOD, easy to set up . fast deliveryRead more | Good product with no lagging, low weightLook and design is good.Good functionality.Good value in budget.Read more"
